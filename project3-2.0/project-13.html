     <p>We created a circular wire structure that was nailed to a wooden cross that would support all the cermaic multiples and create a circle, allowing viewers to walk in side and around it. I also played sounds of children playing outside to heighten the severity of the issue the installation is trying to tackle.  </p>

     <p>We created 50 gun shell mutiples made out of clay which were also later turned into ceramic. I then splattered red paint on all of them to mimick the effect of blood.</p>
