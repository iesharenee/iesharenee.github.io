             The clutch pedal is what makes driving a manual car more difficult <br> than an automatic car. Without going into too much detail, the clutch <br>is essentially two metal plates that connect the engine to the drive wheels. So, by pressing down on the clutch pedal, you're disconnecting the engine from the wheels.
